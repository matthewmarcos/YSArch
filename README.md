# YSES Archiving System V2

### This is a **remake** of the old YSES Archiving System

This system allows the administrators (Executive Department Members) to upload files to the server and select people who are allowed to view it (logged in ysers).

Accounts must be approved by any Exec member before being able to log in.

Files can be uploaded only by members of the Executive Department. These files will have tags per department. Only members with those department tags shall be allowed to view said files:
- Executive Department
- Projects and Activities Department
- Secretariat Department
- Scholastics Department
- Human Resources Department
- Visuals and Logistics Department
- Finance Department
